# Covid-19-Global-Analysis-Dashboard
Developed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard to offer a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic

• It utilises the vast COVID-19 datasets collection on Kaggle, which includes data on the number of cases worldwide, vaccination rates, death rates, and more

• Using Microsoft Excel, filtered data was prepared for analysis by removing unnecessary details, blank rows and columns, and redundant data

• Leveraging the power of MySQL, various operations were performed on filtered data to gain various insights by importing data from excel to SQL server management studio

• The power of Power BI allow users to explore data by drilling down into specific location, year and region
