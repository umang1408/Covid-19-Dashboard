# Covid-19-Global-Analysis-Dashboard
I created a thorough COVID-19 global analytic dashboard that displays total cases and fatalities globally, daily case trends from 2020 to 2023, and real-time information on those who have received the vaccine entirely and partially by the user-friendly interface, which makes it easy to explore and comprehend the effects of the worldwide epidemic.
